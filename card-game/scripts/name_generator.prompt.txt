The lists will be further split into groups for NOOB LEVEL, LOW LEVEL, MEDIUM LEVEL, HIGH LEVEL, and EPIC LEVEL creatures.

# RULES
   * The output format must be a valid JSON object with a single list element.
   * Capitalize the names of the creature names as if they are proper titles.
   * Do not provide adjectives in the noun list.
   * Do not provide nouns in the adjective list.
   * Make each list as long as possible and alphabetical.
